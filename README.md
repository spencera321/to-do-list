# to-do-list
To-do list that prioritizes. The goal of this project is to make a to-do-list where the user can submit entries to a to-do-list.
The user will then be prompted to make comparisons on which entry is more important.
The entries will be sorted into a priority list based on the comparisons using the least number of comparisons possible.
